# Reading group

Overview of IR/NLP papers covered in my team's reading group. Typically, we read and discuss one paper per timeslot (1 hour). At times, we may switch up the format (e.g. a shared presentation about a single topic). All PhD and MSc thesis students are expected to attend.

We typically stop those meetings over the summer and during the extended Christmas break.
